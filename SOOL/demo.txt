LO1 Game is minimal, game on future scenario, its about exploring tech, dreams you can realize with what you have and i dont see it, your team opted for a very safe way to explore the tech. Controllers were technology, couldn't show. Minimal 2
LO3 Assignment taking literal, in the future game, but no identified core assumptions about the future, assumptions are about future scenario, the more you think about those, the more they are something that apply to real life. I made a person in the future with scenario and made that the, it didn't have to have anything to do with future scenario, powerless i could have made a game with frogs in a forest about powerlessness. Minimal 2
LO4 Minimal because i wasn't clear about my central message. Lighting thing in the scan, MDA needs to show that designwork if it isn't shown in the game. MDA is most important

pervasiveness, why look at end result instead of future nscenario
Struggled to see what i did differently from papers please
