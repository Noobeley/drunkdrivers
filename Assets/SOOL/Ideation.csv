"Development Feasibility   Nanobot Interaction: Using physics-based interactions for grabbing and manipulating objects in VR.","","","","","","","",""
"Genre: Sci-Fi, Puzzle-Adventure, Medical Simulation","","","","","","","",""
"Nanobot Control in VR:   Players embody a small, humanoid nanobot or control a swarm of smaller bots, navigating various environments inside the body. VR hand controls would allow them to steer through veins, arteries, and organs, dodging white blood cells and navigating intricate pathways.   Interaction Mechanics: Players use VR hand movements to interact with the environment—pulling blockages, zapping infected cells, or repairing tissue through puzzle-solving mechanics.","","","","","","","",""
"Immersive Environments:   Body Systems: The visual design would recreate the interior of the human body with stunning detail—players can see red blood cells float by, the rhythmic pulsing of the heart, or nerve signals firing.   Each environment (lungs, brain, stomach) has distinct visual and gameplay elements.","","","","","","","",""
"Missions:   Each mission begins with a briefing, explaining the health crisis within a patient’s body (e.g., heart attack, severe infection, blocked arteries).   Players are deployed into the body and must navigate to the problem area, solving environmental puzzles and dealing with threats such as viruses, immune responses, or toxins along the way.   Progression: Each successful mission results in a patient’s full recovery, and players earn upgrades to their nanobots or new abilities.   More complex health issues arise as players progress through the game, increasing in difficulty and requiring more skillful play.","","","","","","","",""
"The project scope should focus on delivering 3-5 highly detailed environments with simple yet engaging mechanics like object manipulation, health monitoring, and basic puzzle-solving.","","","","","","","",""
"Setting: The game is set 30 years in the future. Players control nanobots inside a human body, navigating blood vessels, organs, and the nervous system to monitor and repair health conditions. They take on the role of a “medical pilot,” deployed into a patient’s body to solve health crises by repairing cells, removing blockages, or curing infections at a microscopic level.","","","","","","","",""
"Timeframe Feasibility:   7 Weeks is enough time to create a focused game with a few specific missions and distinct body environments, such as the heart, lungs, and brain.","","","","","","","",""
"Hand-based Interactions:   Players use VR hand controllers to manipulate objects within the body. For example, they may use their hands to:   Clear blood clots by grabbing and dissolving them.   Repair broken blood vessels using ""healing beams.""   Direct the flow of white blood cells to infection points by drawing paths with their hands.","","","","","","","",""
"Health Monitoring Challenges:   The player receives real-time feedback on the body’s condition, such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and white bloodcel counts.   Players face time-sensitive challenges like infections spreading through organs or blood clots forming, which they must neutralize by guiding nanobots to the problem areas.","","","","","","","",""
"Puzzle-Solving Inside the Body:   Tissue Repair: Players solve 3D puzzles to stitch tissue back together, arrange cells in the correct sequence, or create antibodies to fight diseases.   Wayfinding: They must figure out the correct route through the body to reach the infected area before it’s too late, facing obstacles like restricted blood flow, immune system defenses, or diseased tissue.","","","","","","","",""
"Upgrades & Customization:   Players can collect or earn upgrades to their nanobots as they progress, such as improved speed, healing capabilities, or more powerful tools for breaking down blockages.","","","","","","","",""

"Aesthetics
Players will be feel relief if no sound is emmited from the monitor (checks if you did ur job correclty)
the players will have to be inquisitive to be somewhat detectives to catch if a npc is lying
players will be exicted  when they discover some discrepency
players will be challanged by travel rules as constraints get tighter and they need to keep up with teh changes added
players feel happy when incenerate the nps that were bad
players will discover new ways the npcs will attempt to trick them in easy and noticable ways to harder and more elaborate
players will have to concetrate while performing surgery
players will feel bad when they see they let some npcs slide due to negligence","Dynamics
incenerating correclty is rewarding
fines are for punishments
the surgery and scanner escalate things
players will have to look at updates of documents and others required to pass","If a player wrongfully incinerates someone they get fined
If a player doesnt incinerate someone that has weapons there are major consequences
The player is not allowed to move they only look around
The incineration button is behind the player
Some people passing through will have dangerous augments while others wont
Moving the controller over certain parts of the NPC you're inspecting
Pressing buttons to ring alarms or to buy upgrades"
